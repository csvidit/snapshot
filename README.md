An under-development NextJS web application that gives the user a snapshot of the day, personalized to their preferences.
Authentication through Auth0.

This app is not available for public sign-ups (mostly due to very limited free API calls available) and is mostly supposed to be a proof of concept at the moment. If you would like to see it in action, please use these test credentials to log in and play around a bit. The user preferences section of the website is under development at the moment. 

**Due to limitations of the free plan, the API used for fetching news will only work when the app is run locally, i.e., at ```localhost:3000``` or similar.**

Twitter is in the process of deprecating its current API and its endpoint for getting Trends data is not available yet, so the 'Trending on Socials' feature's development will take longer.

### Test Credentials
